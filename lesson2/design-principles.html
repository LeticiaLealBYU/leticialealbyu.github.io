                <h2>Proximity</h2>
                <p>Proximity is the placement of items, groups, or elements. The design of a website depends on the proximity of things to form a more organized look.On this mobile website of <a href="https://my.byui.edu/ICS/">My BYUI</a> it shows a good representation of what the proximity is by the spacing of each item on the student area.</p>

                <h2>Repetition</h2>
                <p>Repetition works repeating an element or shape in a page. This is the reusing of the same shape, color, or symbol. The repetition can help to guide the user to a specific location on the webpage if so desired. <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a> has a good example of repetition right at the beggining of the page in the status retangles.</p>

                <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                <p>I believe one of the most important principles of design is the visual hierarchy, it is necessary to make the layout and manage the content in an organized way. This principle defines the priorities of the piece in order to convey the message to the user in a more simplified way, so that they know what t look first, second and so on, I believe the <a href="https://www.byupathway.org/">BYU Pathway Worldwide</a> website is a good example of that from the banner to the end of the page.<br>Link:</p>
