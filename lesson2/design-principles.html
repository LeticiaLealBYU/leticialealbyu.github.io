                <h2>Proximity</h2>
                <p>Proximity is the placement of items, groups, or elements. The design of a website depends on the proximity of things to form a more organized look.On this mobile website of BYUI it shows a good representation of what the proximity is by the spacing of each item on the student area.</p>

                <h2>Repetition</h2>
                <p>This is the repetition of the same shape, color, or symbol. The repetition can help to guide the user to a specific location on the webpage if so desired. Facebook has a good example of repetition right at the beggining of the page in the status retangles.</p>

                <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                <p>This principle defines the priorities of the piece in order to convey the message to the user in a more simplified way, so that they know what t look first, second and so on, I believe the BYU Pathway Worldwide website is a good example of that from the banner to the end of the page.</p>
